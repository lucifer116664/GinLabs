Can I believe? <br>That what I saw that night was real and not just fantasy? <br>Just what I saw in my old dreams <br>Were they reflections of my warped mind staring back at me? <br>'Cause in my dreams it's always there <br>The evil face that twists my mind and brings me to despair <br>Night was black, was no use holding back <br>'Cause I just had to see, was someone watching me? <br>In the mist, dark figures move and twist <br>Was all this for real or just some kind of Hell? <br>Six six six, the number of the beast <br>Hell and fire was spawned to be released <br>Torches blazed and sacred chants were praised <br>As they start to cry, hands held to the sky <br>In the night, the fires are burning bright <br>The ritual has begun, Satan's work is done <br>Six six six, the number of the beast <br>Sacrifice is going on tonight <br>This can't go on, I must inform the law <br>Can this still be real, or just some crazy dream? <br>But I feel drawn towards the chanting hordes <br>Seem to mesmerize, can't avoid their eyes <br>Six six six, the number of the beast <br>Six six six, the one for you and me <br>I'm coming back, I will return <br>And I'll possess your body and I'll make you burn <br>I have the fire, I have the force <br>I have the power to make my evil take its course
